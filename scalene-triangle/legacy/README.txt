Some poorly written legacy code.
The script dsw_pymol_surface_3.py file was a hacky put-together
used to for the scalene triangle study. I rewrote this project
into an entire package for the GitHub repo.

get_delimtxt.py is a script used to create the delimiter list delim.txt (similar
to our previous JSON).
