## Description

Algorithm for find the closest protein surface coordinate relative either a   
metal (**MT**) or bridging SD (**SD**) coordinate. The algorithm assumes that  
the input already contains both a bridging interaction and a metal.

## Step 1  
The input. I approximate a "protein surface" using a set of equidistant coordinates  
spaced a fixed radius from an origin (i.e. _on a circle!_**).
